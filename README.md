Framework for **Vi**suali**z**ation and **A**na**ly**sis of Simulation Data


This is a general framework for Analysis and Visualization of Simulation Data, with the focus being on Cosmology data. 


Until a better solution is found, each subproject will exist in seperate subfolders. Please follow the guidelines for the HelloWorld project to see how to add new subprojects. Add your subproject folder in the "clean-subprojects" target to allow easy deletion of proj. Do your work in a branch too would be useful too. You can have your own branch with master, dev in your subbranch. Contact me (Pascal) for more info.
